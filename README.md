# german_app

The main goal of this project is to create an environment to help learn German. In the future it may be expanded to include other languages to.
In my opinion, someone can achieve much more by speaking than by learning vocabulary by heart, but why pay a tutor to do it? 

This is mainly what my idea is about:
- features that provide interactivity and allow the user to talk freely with the software in German,
- functions that allow the user to learn and repeat random words (consider an algorithm that selects words to repeat),
- functions that allow the user to learn grammar from examples generated by the GPT model.
